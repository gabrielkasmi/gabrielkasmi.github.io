        <h2>Abstract and manuscript</h2>
        <p>
          In November 2023, the French photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity stood at 18.6 GWp, 
          and the French electricity transmission system operator (TSO) lacks power measurements 
          for 20% of the fleet, which mostly correspond to small-scale (rooftop) systems. In 
          the context of decarbonizing the electric mix, the PV installed capacity will continue 
          to experience sustained growth in the coming years, and the so-called problem of poor PV 
          observability threatens its long-term integration into the grid due to the uncertainty it 
          creates. A better knowledge of the rooftop PV fleet, embodied in a nationwide technical 
          registry recording the localization and characteristics of the PV installations, is necessary 
          to improve PV observability. This thesis proposes to assess whether deep learning-based remote 
          sensing on orthoimagery is a suitable method for constructing this technical registry. 
          The thesis first discusses the quality standards the technical registry should satisfy and 
          introduces an unsupervised evaluation method to monitor the accuracy of the registry in the 
          absence of ground truth labels. Second, the thesis introduces a new feature attribution method 
          that enables the auditing of the model's decisions by decomposing its predictions into the 
          space-scale domain. The thesis discusses the relevance of this decomposition for assessing what 
          the model sees on the input image, understanding the model's sensitivity to varying acquisition 
          conditions, which are found to affect the model's accuracy and reliability, and introducing a 
          robust and reliable algorithm for mapping rooftop PV installations. Finally, the relevance of 
          the registry for improving rooftop PV observability is established by showing that accurate 
          and scalable estimations of the rooftop PV power production can be derived from the registry 
          and weather data. This thesis features contributions in power systems by showing how to 
          effectively improve rooftop PV observability and in deep learning by improving the
           interpretability of deep learning models thanks to a new feature attribution method. More 
           generally, this thesis underlines the necessary conditions for using deep learning in 
           critical industrial contexts.

        <p>The manuscript will soon be accessible.</p>
