        <h2 id="Motivation">Motivation and context</h2>

        <p>
          In the current organization of the electric system, the transmission system operator (TSO) 
        is reponsible for the balance betwee the load and supply of electricity. It requires to have
        access to real time measurements of the electric production. While for conventional electricity 
        generation means, wind and hydro power, this does not pose any problem, photovoltaic (PV) energy
        is characterized by a great diversity of systems, ranging from large plants, which are telemetered,
        to small scale, distributed systems. These systems, generally located on rooftop and whose installed 
        capacity is lower than 36 kWp, amount for 20% of the PV installed capacity and are poorly known by the TSO.
        This poor knowledge regarding small scale PV systems not only concerns power measurements, but also
        the knowledge regarding the actuall fleet of systems (localization, individual installed capacity, system characteristics).
        </p>

        <p>
          The rapid growth of PV energy in the context of the energy transition will increase the share of PV energy
          in the electric mix. To continue to ensure the stability of the grid, it will be necessary to increase
          the rooftop PV observability, i.e., the ability of the TSO to estimate the rooftop PV power with good accuracy.
          To this end, two steps are necessary: first increasing the knowledge of the rooftop PV fleet and second leveraging
          this registry to estimate the rooftop PV power production.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the recent years, numerous works leveraged deep learning and orthoimagery to to construct registries of small-scale
          PV systems [,,]. Among them, the DeepSolar project [] was an important milestone as it was among the
          first work to construct a large-scale database of PV systems recording the surface and the localization of the systems.
        </p>

        
        <h2>Scientific question and methodology</h2>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, we cannot straightforwarly apply DeepSolar to France as we need more information on the PV systems
          than only the surface. As our goal is to estimate the PV power production, we need the installed capacity, tilt and azimuth
          angles of the PV systems, which are the minimal necessary information to estimate the PV power production []. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The fundamental limit to deep learning-based methods such as DeepSolar is their sensitivity to distribution shifts, 
          which leads to an unpredictable loss in accuracy if we were to apply the algorithm straightfowardly to France.
          This sensitivity to distribution shifts results in a lack of reliability of deep learning methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          The central contribution of this work is therefore to introduce a framework intended to improve the 
          reliability of deep learning algorithms intended to be used in critical industrial processes such as the 
          remote sensing of rooftop PV systems. The scientific question addressed is the following: Is deep learning-based 
          remote sensing on orthoimagery a suitable method for constructing a nationwide registry of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) 
          installations intended to improve the observability of PV power production in France?
        </p>

        <h2>The three pilars of reliability</h2>

        <p>
          The framework for improving the reliability of deep learning-based algorithms is based on the following 
          three pilars:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitoring</strong>: as deep learning models can fail unpredictably, it is necessary to 
              monitor their accuracy over they operational design domain [], i.e., the data on which they are used in production.
              This evaluation is at most indirect, as by definition there is not labelled data on this domain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Auditing</strong>: we argue that it is necessary to gain intuition on how models work to be able 
              to understand when they might fail and what the practitioner can expect from them. To this end, we leverage explainable AI (XAI)
              techniques. These methods enable to understand how model works, e.g., by shedding light on the important areas
              on an image for making a prediction. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Robustness</strong>: when deployed in production, the input data will be subject to some alterations. 
              While it seems hard to improve the robustness in general, we can at least identify the main source of variability 
              in the input data and improve the model's invariance to such alterations. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>Through this PhD, I made contributions in machine 
          learning and explainable AI, with the introduction of the wavelet 
          scale attribution method (WCAM) and new feature attribution method. 
          I also made contribution in power systems with the introduction 
          of a new algorithm for mapping rooftop PV systems (DeepPVMapper) 
          and the associated database, which is currently the world largest 
          with  this level of detail.
