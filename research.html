        <h2 id="Current">Current Research</h2>

        <h3>Explainability and Signal Processing</h3>

        <p>
          My first topic of interest is to improve our understanding of deep learning models. In computer vision, 
          current methods focus on assessing where models focus on input images. However, these approaches
          are uninformative when it comes to explaining why classification models can fail to correctly predict 
          some instances.
        </p>

        <p>
          My research consists in using tools from classical signal processing theory, in particular the wavelet
          transform, to meaningfully decompose the input image and then to identify the important parts of this 
          decomposition in the model's prediction. I am using the wavelet transform rather than the Fourier transform
          as the wavelet decomposition of an image is localized in space and in frequency, which on images 
          enables us to assess where and what (scales) models see. 
        </p>

        <p>
          During the PhD thesis, we introduced the <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=112o4j4VCY">wavelet scale attribution method (WCAM)</a>, 
          an extension of <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=hA-PHQGOjqQ">Fel's et. al.</a> attribution method
          to the wavelet domain in order to assess what models see on an image. Scales of the wavelet transform correspond to 
          structural components of the image: therefore, we can assess whether the model relies on shapes, textures or other 
          intermediary components to make its prediction. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that the WCAM can be expanded into several interesting directions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, it can be expanded to 1D signals such as sounds,
            </li>
            <li>
              Second, I believe that there can be interesting connections between the scale decomposition 
              obtained with the WCAM and recent concept-based XAI approaches such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10154">CRAFT</a>.   
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, the scales of the wavelet transform are localized in frequency, and several works (see for instance this 
              <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rQ1cNbi07Vq">work</a> or 
              this <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_Amplitude-Phase_Recombination_Rethinking_Robustness_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_Frequency_ICCV_2021_paper.html">one</a>) leveraged
              frequency-based methods to characterize and analyze the robustness of models to various input perturbations. 
            </li>

        <h3>Improving the Observability of Rooftop PV Systems</h3>

        <p>
          The photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity grows very quickly, both worldwide and in France. 
          A specificity of PV energy is that a sizable share of the systems are located on rooftops 
          (20% of the installed capacity in France).
          These rooftop systems are not well known by authorities or transmission system operators. 
          The main goal of my thesis was to look for methods to improve the knowledge regarding 
          the rooftop PV fleet and ultimately to introduce
          new methods for accurately estimating the PV power production.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the thesis, we've introduced a method for constructing a large scale registry of rooftop PV systems 
          and demonstrated that we could estimate the rooftop PV power production with relatively few information 
          on these systems. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The last chapter of the thesis raises a lot of questions for improving current methods for PV power estimation,
          in particular since the task of fairly comparing the proposed method with the TSO current practices is very challenging. 
          I also have in mind potential applications beyond France, for instance in countries where the share of small scale PV is 
          higher than in France.

          <b>Abstract</b>:
          Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation plays a crucial role in the energy 
          transition. Small-scale, rooftop PV installations are deployed at an unprecedented 
          pace, and their safe integration into the grid requires up-to-date, high-quality 
          information. Overhead imagery is increasingly being used to improve the knowledge 
          of rooftop PV installations with machine learning models capable of automatically 
          mapping these installations. However, these models cannot be reliably transferred 
          from one region or imagery source to another without incurring a decrease in accuracy. 
          To address this issue, known as distribution shift, and foster the development of PV array 
          mapping pipelines, we propose a dataset containing aerial images, segmentation masks, and 
          installation metadata (i.e., technical characteristics). We provide installation metadata 
          for more than 28000 installations. We supply ground truth segmentation masks for 13000 
          installations, including 7000 with annotations for two different image providers. Finally, 
          we provide installation metadata that matches the annotation for more than 8000 installations. 
          Dataset applications include end-to-end PV registry construction, robust PV installations 
          mapping, and analysis of crowdsourced datasets. The article can be accessed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01951-4">here</a> and the

          <b>Abstract</b>:
          The global photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity, vital for the electric sector‚Äôs decarbonation, 
          reached 1552.3 GWp in 2023. In France, the capacity stood at 19.9 GWp in April 2024. 
          The growth of the PV installed capacity over a year was nearly 32% worldwide and 15.7% in France. 
          However, integrating PV electricity into grids is hindered by poor knowledge of 
          rooftop PV systems, constituting 20% of France‚Äôs installed capacity, and the lack of 
          measurements of the production stemming from these systems. This problem of lack of 
          measurements of the rooftop PV power production is referred to as the lack of 
          observability. Using ground-truth measurements of individual PV systems, available 
          at an unprecedented temporal and spatial scale, we show that by estimating the PV 
          power production of an individual rooftop system by combining solar irradiance and 
          temperature data, the characteristics of the PV system inferred from remote sensing 
          methods and an irradiation-to-electric power conversion model provides accurate estimations 
          of the PV power production. We report an average estimation error (measured with the pRMSE) 
          of 10% relative to the system size. Our study shows that we can improve rooftop PV 
          observability, and thus its integration into the electric grid, using little information 
          on these systems, a simple model of the PV system, and weather data. More broadly, this 
          study shows that limited information is sufficient to derive a reasonably good estimation 
          of the PV power production of small-scale systems. The article can be accessed <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/en17174353">here</a>.

          <b>Abstract</b>:
          Photovoltaic (PV) energy grows rapidly and is crucial for the decarbonization of electric systems. 
          However, centralized registries recording the technical characteristics of rooftop PV systems are 
          often missing, making it difficult to monitor this growth accurately. The lack of monitoring could 
          threaten the integration of PV energy into the grid. To avoid this situation, remote sensing of 
          rooftop PV systems using deep learning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing 
          techniques are not reliable enough to be used by public authorities or transmission system 
          operators (TSOs) to construct up-to-date statistics on the rooftop PV fleet. The lack of 
          reliability comes from deep learning models being sensitive to distribution shifts. This 
          work comprehensively evaluates distribution shifts‚Äô effects on the classification accuracy 
          of deep learning models trained to detect rooftop PV panels on overhead imagery. We construct 
          a benchmark to isolate the sources of distribution shifts and introduce a novel methodology 
          that leverages explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and decomposition of the input image 
          and model‚Äôs decision regarding scales to understand how distribution shifts affect deep learning 
          models. Finally, based on our analysis, we introduce a data augmentation technique designed to 
          improve the robustness of deep learning classifiers under varying acquisition conditions. Our 
          proposed approach outperforms competing methods and can close the gap with more demanding 
          unsupervised domain adaptation methods. We discuss practical recommendations for mapping PV 
          systems using overhead imagery and deep learning models.

          This work in process was presented during the PhD Forum at ECML-PKDD 2022. 
          It it a snapshot of our early attempts to use Fourier theory to explain the (lack of) 
          robustness of a CNN classifier. This work later led to the WCAM.
