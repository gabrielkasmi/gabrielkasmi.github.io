          <b>Abstract</b>:
          Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation plays a crucial role in the energy 
          transition. Small-scale, rooftop PV installations are deployed at an unprecedented 
          pace, and their safe integration into the grid requires up-to-date, high-quality 
          information. Overhead imagery is increasingly being used to improve the knowledge 
          of rooftop PV installations with machine learning models capable of automatically 
          mapping these installations. However, these models cannot be reliably transferred 
          from one region or imagery source to another without incurring a decrease in accuracy. 
          To address this issue, known as distribution shift, and foster the development of PV array 
          mapping pipelines, we propose a dataset containing aerial images, segmentation masks, and 
          installation metadata (i.e., technical characteristics). We provide installation metadata 
          for more than 28000 installations. We supply ground truth segmentation masks for 13000 
          installations, including 7000 with annotations for two different image providers. Finally, 
          we provide installation metadata that matches the annotation for more than 8000 installations. 
          Dataset applications include end-to-end PV registry construction, robust PV installations 
          mapping, and analysis of crowdsourced datasets.

        <h3>Abstract and manuscript</h3>
        <p>
          In November 2023, the French photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity stood at 18.6 GWp, 
          and the French electricity transmission system operator (TSO) lacks power measurements 
          for 20% of the fleet, which mostly correspond to small-scale (rooftop) systems. In 
          the context of decarbonizing the electric mix, the PV installed capacity will continue 
          to experience sustained growth in the coming years, and the so-called problem of poor PV 
          observability threatens its long-term integration into the grid due to the uncertainty it 
          creates. A better knowledge of the rooftop PV fleet, embodied in a nationwide technical 
          registry recording the localization and characteristics of the PV installations, is necessary 
          to improve PV observability. This thesis proposes to assess whether deep learning-based remote 
          sensing on orthoimagery is a suitable method for constructing this technical registry. 
          The thesis first discusses the quality standards the technical registry should satisfy and 
          introduces an unsupervised evaluation method to monitor the accuracy of the registry in the 
          absence of ground truth labels. Second, the thesis introduces a new feature attribution method 
          that enables the auditing of the model's decisions by decomposing its predictions into the 
          space-scale domain. The thesis discusses the relevance of this decomposition for assessing what 
          the model sees on the input image, understanding the model's sensitivity to varying acquisition 
          conditions, which are found to affect the model's accuracy and reliability, and introducing a 
          robust and reliable algorithm for mapping rooftop PV installations. Finally, the relevance of 
          the registry for improving rooftop PV observability is established by showing that accurate 
          and scalable estimations of the rooftop PV power production can be derived from the registry 
          and weather data. This thesis features contributions in power systems by showing how to 
          effectively improve rooftop PV observability and in deep learning by improving the
           interpretability of deep learning models thanks to a new feature attribution method. More 
           generally, this thesis underlines the necessary conditions for using deep learning in 
           critical industrial contexts.

          This work in process was presented during the PhD Forum at ECML-PKDD 2022. It it a snapshot of our
          early attempts to use Fourier theory to explain the (lack of) robustness of a CNN classifier. This work
          later led to the WCAM. The manuscript is accessible
