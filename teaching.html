        <h3>Group projects</h3>

        <h4><strong>Since 2022</strong>: Applied statistics projects at ENSAE</h4>

        <p>
          About 20h of teaching load to a group of 2nd year students of engineering degree 
          at ENSAE Paris ("<a href="https://www.ensae.fr/courses/1408-groupe-de-statistique-appliquee">groupe de statistiques appliquées</a>").

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>2024-2025</strong> : Detection of PV systems from UAV images in Madagascar
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In 2023, global renewable energy capacity reached a record 3,870 GW, 
            thanks to growth of 473 GW, 73% of which came from solar power. 
            Despite this dynamism, the geographical distribution remains uneven, particularly in Africa, 
            where the increase was only 4.6%, well short of the continent's needs. To bridge 
            this gap, solutions such as remote sensing, already widely used in developed countries, 
            could play a crucial role in promoting the integration of renewable energies in developing countries. 
            
            The aim of this study is to propose the first application of a convolutional 
            neural network (CNN) to the remote sensing of rooftop PV installations in Madagascar. 
            The students will use training data from an openly available dataset to train and test their model. 
  
            The students will also discover the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning, incluring empirical risk minimization,
            model training (loss minimization, gradient descent), model architectures and implement on a GPU-based instance
            a deep learning model. This course gives the students a first hands-on experience with deep learning for
            classification and segementation.
          </p>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          The project title was "Deep learning for detecting individual solar systems from aerial images". 
          The students tasks were to carry out a short literature review, define the fundamental notions of machine learning and deep learning
          (empirical risk minimization, perceptron, neural network, convolutional layers, CNN) and to 
          implement a custom-made and a ready-to-use neural network for binary classification on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01951-4">BDAPPV</a>.
          The students leveraged PyTorch to train and evaluate the classification model. The project repository 
          can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/gabrielkasmi/statapp-ensae">here</a> and the students' implementation

        <h4><strong>February-July 2023 </strong>: Computer science project at Mines Paris</h4>

        <p>
          About 20h of teaching load to a group of 1st year students of the engineering degree at Mines Paris 
          ("<a href="https://catalogue.mines-paristech.fr/#cp=course&group=IC1A&course=ECUE22.3&mainTab=COURSEgeneralites">projet d'informatique</a>"). 

          The students task was to implement a website to visualize the outputs of DeepPVMapper (in a similar fashion 
          as <a href="https://waynehuu.github.io/solarMapper/">this website</a>). The main tasks were to implement an architecture with a client and a host
          based on Flask, to implement spatial indexing and preprocessing of the raw data 
          to minimize the loading times and to propose
          some complementary statistics (e.g. the number of systems or the cumulated installed capacity per city). 
          The project repository can be accessed <a href="https://git.sophia.mines-paristech.fr/oie/projet-info-pv">here</a>.
          This project was co-supervised with R. Jolivet.

        <h3>Internships</h3>

        
          <h4>
            <strong>February-August 2025</strong>: End of study internship of Sarah Mehiyddine
          </h4>
        

        <p>
          Photovoltaic (PV) energy plays a major role in the energy transition in France and in Europe. 
          Between 2022 and 2023, the PV installed capacity grew by 16.6% in France 26.1% in the European 
          Union. PV energy is characterized by a large diversity of systems and its growth has been 
          possible notably thanks to rooftop PV systems. Measures such as feed-in tariffs incentivized 
          households to adopt PV systems, and currently, the legislative framework has shifted towards 
          encouraging self-consumption [3]. In the former, the user was paid a fixed amount for its energy 
          produced. In the latter, the user is no longer paid for the energy produced by its system but 
          instead directly consumes its energy. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the context of strong growth, self-consumption will impact on the electric system and will 
          affect the depth of PV adoption. The motivations behind self-consumption are not only purely 
          economic or technical, as ethical factors also come into play. On the other hand, access 
          to self-consumption is uneven, and its requirements (e.g., home ownership) can restrict the diffusion 
          of rooftop PV systems among some underprivileged communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Understanding the drivers of rooftop PV adoption is of interest for to wide range of stakeholders, 
          ranging from policymakers to utilities such as transmission system operators. On the one hand, it 
          can help assess whether the current legislative framework is adapted to meet the adoption goals and 
          determine if additional mechanisms should be implemented or potential limitations should be lifted to 
          foster PV adoption. On the other hand, it can help utilities such as TSOs to calibrate their projections 
          regarding the adoption of rooftop PV, thus preventing potential under or over-investments in the system. 
          One of the key limitations for studying the drivers of residential PV adoption is the lack of disaggregated 
          data regarding the PV systems. Over the last years, this limitation has been gradually lifted in several European 
          countries and regions such as France, the Netherlands, Northern Italy, or the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
          Indeed, these regions’ rooftop PV systems have been mapped thanks to overhead imagery and artificial 
          intelligence algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of the internship is to study the drivers behind residential solar adoption in Europe, 
          with an emphasis on France. Using the rooftop PV registry acquired by RTE with DeepPVMapper,
          the intern will build on existing works to construct a methodology to identify the socio-economic 
          and demographic drivers behind PV adoption.
        </p>

        
          <h4>
            <strong>March-September 2022</strong>: End of study internship of Yann Trémenbert
          </h4>
        

        <p>
          Photovoltaic (PV) energy grows at an unprecedented pace, which makes it difficult to 
          maintain up-to-date and accurate PV registries, which are critical for many applications 
          such as PV power generation estimation. This lack of qualitative data is especially true 
          in the case of rooftop PV installations. As a result, extensive efforts are put into the 
          constitution of PV inventories. However, although valuable, these registries cannot be 
          directly used for monitoring the deployment of PV or estimating the PV power generation, 
          as these tasks usually require PV systems {\it characteristics}. To seamlessly extract 
          these characteristics from the global inventories, we introduce PyPVRoof. PyPVRoof is a 
          Python package to extract essential PV installation characteristics. These characteristics 
          are tilt angle, azimuth, surface, localization, and installed capacity. PyPVRoof is designed 
          to cover all use cases regarding data availability and user needs and is based on a benchmark 
          of the best existing methods. Data for replicating our accuracy benchmarks are available 
          on our Zenodo repository
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7586879"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7586879.svg" alt="DOI"></a>
          , and the package code is accessible at this <a href="https://github.com/gabrielkasmi/pypvroof">URL</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The main tasks of the internship included an extensive literature review of the existing works in 
          the field of extracting characteristics of PV systems, a benchmark of these methods and an implementation
          of new methods (e.g. Theil-Sen regression). All methods were extensively compared both in terms of 
          accuracy and in terms of computational cost on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01951-4">BDAPPV</a>.
          Yann put a particular emphasis on the environmental impact of his coding practices and 
          the methods that he implemented. The idea to discuss the environmental impact of DeepPVMapper 
          (appendix A of the thesis manuscript) was brought by him. This internship was co-supervised with L. Dubus.
