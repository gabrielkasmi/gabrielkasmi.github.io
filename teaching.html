        <h4>Group projects</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>October 2022-May 2023</strong>: Applied statistics projects at ENSAE
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          About 20h of teaching load to a group of 2nd year students of engineering degree 
          at ENSAE Paris ("<a href="https://www.ensae.fr/courses/1408-groupe-de-statistique-appliquee">groupe de statistiques appliquées</a>").

          The project title was "Deep learning for detecting individual solar systems from aerial images". 
          The students tasks were to carry out a short literature review, define the fundamental notions of machine learning and deep learning
          (empirical risk minimization, perceptron, neural network, convolutional layers, CNN) and to 
          implement a custom-made and a ready-to-use neural network for binary classification on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01951-4">BDAPPV</a>.
          The students leveraged PyTorch to train and evaluate the classification model. The project repository 
          can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/gabrielkasmi/statapp-ensae">here</a> and the students' implementation 
          <a href="https://github.com/Basso42/DeepPVClassification">here</a>.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>February-July 2023</strong>: Computer science project at Mines Paris
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          About 20h of teaching load to a group of 1st year students of the engineering degree at Mines Paris 
          ("<a href="https://catalogue.mines-paristech.fr/#cp=course&group=IC1A&course=ECUE22.3&mainTab=COURSEgeneralites">projet d'informatique</a>"). 

          The students task was to implement a website to visualize the outputs of DeepPVMapper (in a similar fashion 
          as <a href="https://waynehuu.github.io/solarMapper/">this website</a>). The main tasks were to implement an architecture with a client and a host
          based on Flask, to implement spatial indexing and preprocessing of the raw data 
          to minimize the loading times and to propose
          some complementary statistics (e.g. the number of systems or the cumulated installed capacity per city). 
          This project was co-supervised with R. Jolivet.

        <h3>2021-2022</h3>

        <h4>Internships</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>March-September 2022</strong>: End of study internship of Yann Trémenbert
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Photovoltaic (PV) energy grows at an unprecedented pace, which makes it difficult to 
          maintain up-to-date and accurate PV registries, which are critical for many applications 
          such as PV power generation estimation. This lack of qualitative data is especially true 
          in the case of rooftop PV installations. As a result, extensive efforts are put into the 
          constitution of PV inventories. However, although valuable, these registries cannot be 
          directly used for monitoring the deployment of PV or estimating the PV power generation, 
          as these tasks usually require PV systems {\it characteristics}. To seamlessly extract 
          these characteristics from the global inventories, we introduce PyPVRoof. PyPVRoof is a 
          Python package to extract essential PV installation characteristics. These characteristics 
          are tilt angle, azimuth, surface, localization, and installed capacity. PyPVRoof is designed 
          to cover all use cases regarding data availability and user needs and is based on a benchmark 
          of the best existing methods. Data for replicating our accuracy benchmarks are available 
          on our Zenodo repository
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7586879"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7586879.svg" alt="DOI"></a>
          , and the package code is accessible at this <a href="https://github.com/gabrielkasmi/pypvroof">URL</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The main tasks of the internship included an extensive literature review of the existing works in 
          the field of extracting characteristics of PV systems, a benchmark of these methods and an implementation
          of new methods (e.g. Theil-Sen regression). All methods were extensively compared both in terms of 
          accuracy and in terms of computational cost on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01951-4">BDAPPV</a>.
          Yann put a particular emphasis on the environmental impact of his coding practices and 
          the methods that he implemented. The idea to discuss the environmental impact of DeepPVMapper 
          (appendix A of the thesis manuscript) was brought by him. This internship was co-supervised with L. Dubus.
